                    De Correspondent is an online journalistic platform, providing members with in-depth articles. I like reading their articles and I was wondering if I could come up with a different design for their articles, as a design challenge of sorts.

                <p class="par">
                    Although I think the articles on De Correspondent are great in terms of legibility, I tried to find another font combination that added something more funky and editorial. I chose Roslindale for titles and headings, and the sublime IBM Plex for the body text.

                <p class="par">
                    In the current site, the body text is placed on a white background, which is in turn placed on a grey background. This, to me, was a bit of a distraction. I placed the text on a fully white background, using quotes from the original article to break the length of the article.

                <p class="par">
                    Each article comes with some 'metadata' about the article. This includes the date of the article, reading time and the option to save the article for a later time. In the current website, this information is kind of scattered. I decided to place this information in a single, clear element.

                <p class="par">
                    The end result is an experiment i'm quite happy with. It served as a great excercise in typography, shapes and information hierarchy.
